# IT Company Task Manager
I have a team of Developers, Designers, Project Managers, and QA specialists. 
Also, I have a lot of tasks connected with the IT-sphere. 
But somehow, I still haven't heard anything about Trello or ClickUp. 
So, I decided to implement my own Task Manager, which will handle all 
    possible problems during product development in my team. 
    Everyone from the team can create tasks, assign these tasks to team members,
    and mark the tasks as done (of course, better before the deadlines).


### Ideas to add:

- For each worker it is shown separately: completed and not completed tasks.
- Add Tags (like landing-page-layout or python-refactoring) for tasks with Many-to-Many relationship.
- Add support for Projects and Teams, different teams can work on different projects, and also inside projects there are a lot of tasks to do (complicated).


toDo
- add which worker should do this task/ or has this position
- my task

future work - add alternative solution (client side with JS) for completed/uncompleted tasks
when in `all`, btn should be unactive
add checkbox for tasks in the main task-list page (and save with js??)
